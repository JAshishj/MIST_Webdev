                    Bisi Bele Bahth is one of Karnataka's most iconic dishes, literally translating to "Hot Lentil Rice."
                    It is a wholesome one-pot meal made with rice, toor dal (pigeon peas), tamarind, jaggery, and a special spice mix called Bisi Bele Bhath Powder. 
                    The dish has a perfect balance of spicy, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors, making it unique from regular sambar rice. 
                    Often served hot with ghee, boondi, or papad, it is a comfort food loved across the state. 
                    Traditionally, it is prepared during festivals and family gatherings, but it has also become a common dish in hotels and homes alike.

            <p class="text" id="neer_text">
                Neer Dosa is a soft, lace-like dosa made from a watery rice batter, native to coastal Karnataka.
                Unlike regular dosa, it does not require fermentation, making it quick and easy to prepare.
                The word "Neer" means water in Kannada, referring to the thin consistency of the batter. 
                These dosas are light, soft, and melt in the mouth. 
                They are usually served with coconut chutney, vegetable sagu, chicken curry, or fish curry. 
                Because of their light texture, they are ideal for breakfast or dinner. 
                Neer Dosa reflects the simple yet flavorful food culture of the coastal belt of Karnataka.

                Masala Dosa is perhaps the most recognized South Indian dish across the world, and Karnataka has played a big role in popularizing it. 
                It is a thin, crispy crepe made from fermented rice and urad dal batter.
                The dosa is usually filled with a spiced potato and onion curry, which adds flavor and texture. 
                Served hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar, it makes for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.
                While there are many varieties of dosa, the masala dosa stands out for its balance of crispness on the outside and softness on the inside.
                Originating in Udupi, it has become a symbol of Karnataka's vegetarian cuisine.

                Akki Rotti is a traditional Karnataka dish made from rice flour, often mixed with onions, green chilies, coriander, and grated vegetables like carrots. 
                The dough is patted thin directly on a hot griddle or banana leaf and then roasted until golden brown.
                It is typically enjoyed with coconut chutney or a spicy chutney powder, and sometimes paired with curd. 
                Akki Rotti is a staple breakfast in many rural and urban households because it is both filling and nutritious. 
                Its name literally means “rice bread,” and it reflects the heavy use of rice in Karnataka's cuisine, particularly in regions like Bangalore and Mysore.

            <p class="text" id="kesari_text">
                Kesari Bhath is a delicious sweet dish prepared from semolina (rava), sugar, ghee, and flavored with cardamom. 
                It gets its name from “Kesari,” meaning saffron, which gives the dish its golden-yellow color. 
                Often garnished with cashews and raisins fried in ghee, this melt-in-the-mouth dessert is popular during festivals, functions, and as a special breakfast treat. 
                It is also a common offering in temples. In Karnataka, Kesari Bhath is often paired with Khara Bhath (a savory upma) and served together as “Chow Chow Bath,” giving a mix of both sweet and spicy flavors on one plate. 
                Its rich taste makes it a favorite across age groups.

            <p class="text" id="buns_text">
                Mangalore Buns are a unique breakfast or tea-time snack originating from the coastal city of Mangalore. 
                Despite the name, they are not actual buns but soft, slightly sweet, deep-fried pooris made with mashed bananas, flour, sugar, and curd. 
                They puff up beautifully when fried and have a fluffy inside with a mild sweetness. 
                They are usually served with coconut chutney or vegetable curry, but many enjoy them plain with tea or coffee. 
                The use of overripe bananas in the recipe not only avoids wastage but also gives the dish a distinct flavor. 
                Mangalore Buns are a true coastal delicacy and showcase the creative side of Karnataka's cuisine.

                Goli Baje, also called Mangalore Bajji, is a popular snack from coastal Karnataka.
                These are soft, fluffy fritters made from maida (refined flour), yogurt, green chilies, ginger, and curry leaves. 
                The batter is deep-fried into round balls, which are crispy on the outside and soft inside. 
                Goli Baje is often served hot with coconut chutney and is a staple evening snack in Mangalore households and restaurants. 
                Their slightly tangy taste, thanks to the yogurt fermentation, makes them addictive. 
                Usually enjoyed with tea or coffee, Goli Baje reflects the coastal love for fried, flavorful snacks that bring families together in the evenings.

            <p class="text" id="chow_text">
                Chow Chow Bhath is a classic Karnataka breakfast that offers both sweet and savory flavors on a single plate. 
                It consists of two dishes served together: Khara Bhath (a spicy upma made with semolina, vegetables, and spices) and Kesari Bhath (a sweet semolina dish flavored with saffron or cardamom). 
                The combination provides a contrast of tastes — spicy and tangy from the Khara Bath, and sweet and rich from the Kesari Bath. 
                This pairing is widely enjoyed in Bangalore eateries and is often considered the perfect breakfast for those who can't decide between sweet and savory. 
                It beautifully showcases Karnataka's balance of flavors.
